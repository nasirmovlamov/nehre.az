            Meet our suppliers of homemade pickles and canned food - Zinaida and Sergey Belan.
            A small family business in Korolyov started in 2013 with the production of dumplings. Until 2013, Zinaida Vladimirovna worked in a restaurant as a cook and technologist, and literally all visitors liked her dumplings. Soon the guests wanted to enjoy them not only in the restaurant, but also at home. Then the Belan family and their friends came up with the idea to open their own production and cook only their favorite dishes. At first there were only 3 types of dumplings, and then cutlets, manti and several types of pickles were added to the assortment.

            he Belan family prepares pickles and preparations according to unique homemade recipes, slightly modified in accordance with the technological standards of food production. “We tried to preserve the taste of homemade tomatoes, pickles and our favorite eggplant caviar, familiar from childhood,” says Zinaida. We confirm, they literally take us back to grandma's dinner with jacket potatoes, fragrant cutlets and signature "twists".

            In 2019, the Belan family, together with their friend and partner (and our supplier!) Dmitry Kuleshov, opened a new spacious workshop with additional storage space. Zinaida and Sergey are constantly working in the production, and 5-10 people help them, depending on the season and workload. All preservation is made only from farm raw materials that have passed strict selection for safety and compliance with high quality standards. Vegetables are purchased only seasonal, mainly from the Krasnodar Territory and the Rostov Region.
